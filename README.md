Project Title
Clinic Booking System

Description
The Clinic Booking System is a database solution designed to manage various aspects of a medical clinic, including:

Patient Management: Tracking patient information such as name, email, and date of birth.

Doctor Management: Handling doctor details, including specialization, name, contact details, etc.

Appointment Scheduling: Facilitating appointments between patients and doctors.

Prescription Management: Recording prescriptions for each patient during appointments.

Specialization Tracking: Managing different specializations (e.g., cardiology, dermatology) for doctors.

This system uses MySQL for data management and implements a relational database structure with the appropriate relationships, constraints, and sample data.

How you can run/set up.

. Create the Database (Optional)
Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL tool.

Optionally, create a new database to store the project data.

3. Execute the SQL Script
Copy the provided SQL script (the one containing table creation and data insertion) into the SQL query window of your MySQL tool.

Run the script to create the tables, relationships, and insert the sample data.

4. Verify the Setup
After executing the script, check if the tables have been created successfully by running a query to list the tables in the database.

You can view the data inserted into the tables by running SELECT queries.

5. Test the Database
Use sample SQL queries to retrieve and verify the data inserted into the database.

6. Visualize the ERD
Optionally, you can generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using a tool like dbdiagram.io or draw.io for better visualization of the database structure.

7. Modify and Extend
Feel free to modify the database as needed for additional features, or to extend it with new functionality.
